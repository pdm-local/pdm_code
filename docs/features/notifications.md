# Desktop Notifications

When PDM Code is running a long task in the background, you might switch to another window and miss when it needs your input. Desktop notifications let you know when attention is required.

## Quick Start

Open `/settings` and select **Notifications** to enable them. Toggle which events you want to be notified about:

- **Tool Confirmation**: a tool call needs your approval
- **Question Prompt**: the AI has asked you a question
- **Generation Complete**: the AI has finished responding and is ready for your next message
- **Triggered Run Complete**: a daemon-triggered skill run has finished

You can also enable notification **sound**, and a **Terminal Bell** that writes a BEL character to stdout. The bell is rendered by the terminal emulator itself, so it still reaches you over SSH or inside tmux, where the desktop notifiers cannot land.

The bell rides along with the desktop notification, so it needs the master **Notifications** toggle on as well - Terminal Bell on its own does nothing. If you are inside tmux and hear nothing, tmux swallows the bell unless it is configured to pass it through:

```
set -g monitor-bell on
set -g bell-action any
```

## How It Works

PDM Code uses native OS notification APIs, no bundled binaries or external dependencies.

| Platform | Method | Icon Support |
|----------|--------|:------------:|
| **macOS** | `terminal-notifier` (if installed) | Yes |
| **macOS** | `osascript` (fallback) | No |
| **Linux** | `notify-send` | Yes |
| **Windows** | PowerShell toast | No |

### macOS, Getting the Best Experience

By default, PDM Code falls back to `osascript` which shows basic notifications without the PDM Code icon. For the full experience with icon support and proper click-to-focus behaviour, install `terminal-notifier` via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

PDM Code will automatically detect and use it. You may need to allow notifications for `terminal-notifier` in **System Settings > Notifications** the first time.

### Linux

Notifications use `notify-send`, which is included with most desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.). The PDM Code icon is included automatically when available.

## Configuration

Notification preferences are stored in `pdm-preferences.json` under the top-level `notifications` key. You can configure them via `/settings` or by editing the file directly:

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sound": true,
    "bell": true,
    "events": {
      "toolConfirmation": true,
      "questionPrompt": true,
      "generationComplete": false
    },
    "customMessages": {
      "toolConfirmation": {
        "title": "Action Required",
        "message": "PDM Code needs your approval"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master toggle for all notifications |
| `sound` | boolean | `false` | Play a sound with each notification |
| `bell` | boolean | `false` | Also write a terminal bell (BEL) to stdout, skipped when stdout is not a TTY |
| `events.toolConfirmation` | boolean | `true` | Notify when a tool needs approval |
| `events.questionPrompt` | boolean | `true` | Notify when the AI asks a question |
| `events.generationComplete` | boolean | `true` | Notify when a response is ready |
| `events.triggeredRunComplete` | boolean | `true` | Notify when a daemon-triggered skill run finishes |
| `customMessages.<event>` | object |, | Override the default title and message for an event |

Notification titles include the current project directory name, e.g. "Tool Confirmation Required in my-project".
