# ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

PDM Code can run as an [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP) server, letting ACP-compatible clients drive it as a native coding agent. Instead of the Ink terminal UI, PDM Code speaks JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout, and the client renders the conversation, tool calls, diffs, and permission prompts in its own UI.

```bash
pdm --acp
```

You normally don't run this command yourself, the editor or extension spawns it for you (see [Setup in Zed](#setup-in-zed) and the [VS Code extension](vscode-extension.md)).

## ACP vs. the VS Code companion

ACP is the transport for both the **VS Code sidebar chat** and other ACP clients (Zed, etc.). The older `--vscode` WebSocket path is a separate, opt-in **legacy terminal companion** for Ink TUI sessions, not how the sidebar works.

| | Transport | Flag | Clients |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ACP** | JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout | `--acp` | VS Code sidebar, Zed, and other ACP clients |
| **Legacy companion** | WebSocket | `--vscode` | VS Code (opt-in terminal companion) |

With ACP the **client is the UI**: the agent runs headless and everything (streaming text, tool cards, diffs, approvals) is rendered by the editor or sidebar. The legacy `--vscode` companion keeps the PDM Code terminal TUI in charge and adds diff previews and editor context on top, see [Legacy Companion Mode](vscode-extension.md#legacy-companion-mode).

## What works over ACP

- **Streaming responses** including reasoning/thinking, rendered in the editor's agent panel.
- **Tool calls with rich cards**: file tools report their kind and the files they touch, and edits (`string_replace`, `write_file`) include a **before/after diff** the editor can preview.
- **Permission prompts**: tools that need approval surface as the editor's own allow/deny prompt, respecting the current [development mode](development-modes.md).
- **Development modes**: `normal`, `auto-accept`, `yolo`, and `plan` are exposed as ACP session modes and selectable from the editor (sessions start in `auto-accept`).
- **Model display and switching**: the editor shows the current model and lets you switch between the models configured for your active provider.
- **`ask_user`**: when the agent asks a clarifying question, the options appear as selectable buttons in the editor. (Selection only; a free-form typed answer is not available over ACP.)
- **`@`-mentioned files**: files you reference in the editor are read and included in the prompt, using the editor's live buffer (including unsaved edits) when available.
- **Session reload**: reopening a thread is supported, so the editor won't error when restoring a session.

## Setup in Zed

[Zed](https://zed.dev) is the reference ACP client. Register PDM Code as a custom agent in Zed's `settings.json` (`Cmd+,`, or **zed: open settings** from the command palette):

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "PDM Code": {
      "command": "pdm",
      "args": ["--acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then:

1. Open a project folder in Zed (one that has a PDM Code provider configured, see [Requirements](#requirements)).
2. Open the **Agent Panel** and use the **New Thread** dropdown.
3. Choose **PDM Code** and start prompting.

To pin a specific provider or model for the editor session, add them to `args`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "PDM Code": {
      "command": "pdm",
      "args": ["--acp", "--provider", "ollama", "--model", "qwen2.5-coder:7b"]
    }
  }
}
```

Otherwise PDM Code uses your configured default provider and last-used model. You can switch models later from Zed's model selector.

## Requirements

- PDM Code installed and on your `PATH` (a global install puts `pdm` on `PATH`).
- A configured provider. The ACP server resolves provider and model the same way the CLI does, from the project's `agents.config.json` (or your global config). See [Providers](../configuration/providers/index.md).
- The editor spawns the agent in your **project directory**, so project-level config and relative paths resolve against the open folder.

## Limitations

- **Session history is in-memory.** Reopening a thread within the same running agent restores its history, but after the editor (and agent process) fully restarts, a reloaded thread starts empty, it is usable, but prior messages are not replayed.
- **`ask_user` is selection-only.** ACP permission options have no text input, so the model receives whichever option you pick rather than a typed answer.
- **Images and audio are not processed.** Non-text attachments are noted to the model but not interpreted.

## Troubleshooting

**PDM Code doesn't appear / the thread fails to start**

- Confirm `pdm --acp` runs from your shell. If the editor was launched from the desktop (not a terminal), it may not see your shell's `PATH`, use an absolute path to the binary, or to the Node runtime, in the `command`/`args`.
- Check the editor's agent/log output for the spawn error.

**"No provider configured" or it exits immediately**

- The open folder has no resolvable provider/model. Add an `agents.config.json` to the project (or your global config), or pass `--provider`/`--model` in `args`. See [Configuration](../configuration/index.md).

**Tagged files aren't seen by the model**

- Make sure you reference the file through the editor's own file-mention UI so it sends the file as a resource. Plain text that merely names a path is not read automatically.
