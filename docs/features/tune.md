# Tune

The `/tune` command opens a modal UI for adjusting runtime model behaviour. It lets you change tool profiles, compaction strategy, native tool calling, and model parameters, all without restarting your session.

Settings are persisted to `pdm-preferences.json` and restored on next launch.

## Opening Tune

Type `/tune` in the chat input. Use arrow keys to navigate, **Enter** to select, and **Esc** to cancel.

## Settings

### Enabled / Disabled

The top menu item toggles tune on or off. When disabled, all settings revert to defaults. When enabled, the full settings menu appears.

### Tool Profile

Controls which tools the AI has access to.

| Profile | Tools | Behaviour |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **auto** (default) | Resolves to `full`, `minimal`, or `nano` from the active model id | Cloud/unknown models get `full`; models up to 15B parameters get a reduced profile automatically |
| **full** | All registered tools including MCP servers | No filtering applied |
| **minimal** | 8 core tools: `read_file`, `write_file`, `string_replace`, `execute_bash`, `find_files`, `search_file_contents`, `list_directory`, `agent` | Slim prompt and single-tool enforcement enabled automatically |
| **nano** | 5 core tools: `read_file`, `diff_edit`, `write_file`, `execute_bash`, `search_file_contents` | Ultra-slim prompt, single-tool enforcement, AGENTS.md omitted by default |

The **auto** profile is the default. It keeps the full tool surface for cloud models and model ids with no size hint, resolves models up to 15B parameters to `minimal`, and resolves models up to 4B parameters to `nano`. The status bar shows the resolved profile, for example `tune: minimal (auto)`.

> **What about tasks and walkthroughs?** `write_tasks` and `write_walkthrough` are part of the `full` profile only. Under `minimal` or `nano` the AI will not build a task list or record a completion walkthrough, that prompt and tool budget is spent on editing instead. `/tasks` still works for managing the list yourself. Plan mode is the exception: `write_plan` is added back on every profile so plan review works everywhere. See [Task Management](task-management.md) and [Development Modes](development-modes.md).

> **Why don't I see my MCP tools?** MCP tools are only exposed in the resolved `full` profile. If you connect an MCP server but the model cannot see its tools, open `/tune` and either switch the tool profile to **full** or use a larger/cloud model so `auto` resolves to `full`. `/mcp` still shows connected servers even when the current tool profile filters their tools out of the model prompt.

The **minimal** profile is designed for small models (1B-15B parameters) that struggle with large tool sets. It reduces the system prompt size and forces the model to call one tool at a time.

The **nano** profile is designed for the smallest models or low-end hardware running larger models locally. It is strictly more aggressive than `minimal`:

- Drops `find_files`, `list_directory`, and `agent` (subagent delegation).
- Drops the `CORE PRINCIPLES` and `CODING PRACTICES` prompt sections.
- Uses shortened `TASK APPROACH`, `FILE OPERATIONS`, `CONSTRAINTS` sections (≤4 lines each).
- Replaces the verbose `SYSTEM INFORMATION` block with a single-line `## SYSTEM` line.
- Omits `AGENTS.md` from the system prompt by default (override with the **Include AGENTS.md** toggle).

Together these reduce the system prompt from ~500-700 tokens (`minimal`) to roughly ~150-250 tokens (`nano`), leaving more of the context window for actual work.

### Include AGENTS.md

Toggles whether `AGENTS.md` from the project root is appended to the system prompt.

- Defaults **ON** for `full` and `minimal` profiles (preserves prior behaviour).
- Defaults **OFF** for the `nano` profile.
- Can be flipped explicitly per session, persisted via preferences, or pinned in `agents.config.json` via `tune.includeAgentsMd`.

Disabling this is useful on tiny models that get crowded out by long project guidelines.

### Aggressive Compact

When enabled, sets the auto-compact threshold to 40% and mode to `aggressive`. This compresses conversation history more frequently and aggressively, useful for models with small context windows.

### Native Tool Calling

Toggle native tool calling on or off. When disabled, tools are described in the system prompt and the model uses XML fallback for tool calls instead of the provider's native tool calling API. This can help with models that have unreliable native tool support.

### Model Parameters

Fine-tune the model's generation parameters:

| Parameter | Range | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Temperature** | 0.1 - 2.0 | Controls randomness. Lower = more focused, higher = more creative |
| **Top P** | 0 - 1.0 | Nucleus sampling. Lower = fewer token choices considered |
| **Top K** | 1 - 200 | Limits token choices to top K candidates |
| **Max Tokens** | 64 - 32768 | Maximum response length |
| **Frequency Penalty** | -2.0 - 2.0 | Penalises repeated tokens. Higher = less repetition |
| **Presence Penalty** | -2.0 - 2.0 | Penalises tokens already used. Higher = more topic diversity |

Press **Enter** on a parameter to cycle through values. Select **Reset All to Defaults** to clear all parameter overrides.

### Provider-specific parameters

Some providers accept additional reasoning controls that are configured through `agents.config.json` rather than the `/tune` modal:

- **`reasoningEffort`** / **`reasoningSummary`**, reasoning controls for OpenAI Responses API models (GPT-5, o-series) via the `chatgpt-codex` provider. `reasoningEffort` is also forwarded to OpenRouter as `reasoning.effort`.

OpenRouter exposes additional always-on request body fields (provider routing, plugins, service tier, fallback models, etc) on the provider config itself, see [OpenRouter request options](../configuration/providers/openrouter.md#openrouter-request-options). Those settings are not tied to tune and apply on every request.

## Presets

Three built-in presets are available via **Load Preset**:

| Preset | Settings |
|--------|----------|
| **Default** | Resets everything to defaults (tune disabled) |
| **Small Model** | Minimal tool profile, aggressive compact, temperature 0.7 |
| **Nano (low-end hardware)** | Nano profile, aggressive compact, AGENTS.md off, temperature 0.4, max tokens 2048 |

Selecting a preset populates the tune form, you can further adjust settings before applying.

## Configuration Layers

Tune settings resolve from a 5-layer hierarchy (highest priority wins):

1. **Hardcoded defaults**: `enabled: false`, `toolProfile: 'full'`, `aggressiveCompact: false`
2. **Top-level config**: `tune` in `agents.config.json`
3. **Per-provider config**: `tune` within a provider's configuration
4. **Preferences**: saved via the `/tune` UI to `pdm-preferences.json`
5. **Session override**: runtime changes in the current session

### Example: Per-Provider Config

Set defaults for a specific provider in `agents.config.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "name": "Ollama",
      "type": "ollama",
      "models": ["qwen2.5-coder:7b"],
      "tune": {
        "enabled": true,
        "toolProfile": "minimal",
        "aggressiveCompact": true
      },
      "config": {
        "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This automatically activates tune with the minimal profile whenever you switch to the Ollama provider.

## Interaction with Development Modes

Tune works alongside [development modes](development-modes.md):

- **Plan mode + minimal profile**: the model gets 4 exploration tools (`read_file`, `find_files`, `search_file_contents`, `list_directory`), making it practical for small models to plan
- **Plan mode + nano profile**: the model gets `read_file` and `search_file_contents` for exploration, with the shortened plan-mode prompt
- **Plan mode + full profile**: all plan-mode tools are available, including read-only git, diagnostics, web, and interaction tools
- Mode exclusions are filtered on top of the tune profile

## Status Bar

When tune is active, the status bar shows a summary of your settings:

```
tune: minimal | compact | temp:0.7
```

On narrow terminals, this is shortened to just the profile name.
