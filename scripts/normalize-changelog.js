/**
 * Post-process CHANGELOG.md after `changeset version` so the freshly written
 * top section matches PDM Code's long-standing house style:
 *
 *   - Changesets writes the new release as a level-2 heading ("## 1.29.0")
 *     under the package title. We use level-1 version headings ("# 1.29.0").
 *   - Changesets groups entries under "### Major/Minor/Patch Changes" headers.
 *     We keep a single flat bullet list, and those "###" headers additionally
 *     break changelog parsers (a capture that stops at the first "##+"
 *     heading), so they must go.
 *   - Every release section ends with our standard closing paragraph.
 *
 * The package-title H1 ("# @pdm/pdm-code") is kept permanently at
 * the top of the file - Changesets needs a non-version first line to prepend
 * new releases in the right place.
 *
 * The script is idempotent: if the newest section is already normalised (a
 * level-1 heading), it does nothing.
