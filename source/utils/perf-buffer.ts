/**
 * Performance entry buffer guard.
 *
 * Ink renders the UI via `react-reconciler@0.33`, which (in its development
 * build, which is what ships in `node_modules`) calls `performance.measure()`
 * and `performance.mark()` on every render to surface user-timing entries to
 * the React DevTools track. Those entries are pushed into Node's global
 * performance entry buffer and are never released, because we don't run a
 * `PerformanceObserver` to drain them and there is no equivalent of React
 * DevTools in a terminal.
 *
 * Over a long-running session, particularly one that spawns many subagent
 * runs and re-renders the chat UI for hours, the buffer accumulates millions
 * of entries, V8 spends progressively more time mark-compacting it, and the
 * process eventually crashes with:
 *
 *   FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit
 *   Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
 *
 * (See https://github.com/pdm-local/pdm_code/issues/521.)
 *
 * The mitigation is intentionally narrow: periodically drop the buffered
 * `mark` / `measure` entries. We don't read them anywhere in the app, so this
 * is lossless from our perspective, and it caps the buffer to at most one
 * interval's worth of entries instead of letting it grow unbounded.
