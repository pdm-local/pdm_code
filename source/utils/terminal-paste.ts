 * makes the terminal wrap the payload in `ESC [ 200~` / `ESC [ 201~`, so
 * it can be lifted out of the stream before Ink ever sees it and handed
 * to the input as a single paste.
 *
 * The payload is opaque: it is never scanned for mouse sequences or key
 * bindings, which is the whole point, pasted text that happens to look
 * like an escape sequence stays text.
