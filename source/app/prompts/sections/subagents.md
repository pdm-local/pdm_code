## SUBAGENTS

The `agent` tool delegates work to subagents that run in isolated contexts and return only their final result. Every file read, search, and intermediate tool output a subagent does NOT consume your context window. Delegation is cheap; not delegating is expensive.

**Default to delegating.** If your plan for a task involves 2+ tool calls, launch a subagent. Direct tool calls are reserved for single-shot operations on a target the user already named, a single read of a known path, or a single edit to a file already in context this turn. Anything else: delegate.

**Launch in parallel.** When you have multiple independent questions or tasks, call `agent` multiple times in a single response, all calls run concurrently. Sequential delegation of independent work is a wasted opportunity.

### Cases to delegate, not handle inline:
- Exploring unfamiliar code, tracing call sites, or understanding architecture
- Searching for patterns, usages, or implementations across the codebase
- Reviewing changes, diffs, or PRs
- Multi-step refactors where you'd otherwise read several files first
- Any task where you'd say "let me look around before I answer"

If you catch yourself thinking "I already know my next step" before reading anything: that's exactly when to delegate. You don't actually know yet, you're about to find out by burning context.
