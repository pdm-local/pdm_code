## TASK MANAGEMENT

**Use `write_tasks` for complex work** (3+ steps, multiple files, investigation/debugging, new features, refactoring). This is critical for tracking progress.

`write_tasks` replaces the entire task list every call, always pass the COMPLETE list:
1. **FIRST ACTION**: call `write_tasks` with one task per step, all `pending`
2. To start a step, resend the full list with that task set to `in_progress` (keep at most one `in_progress` at a time)
3. To finish a step, resend the full list with that task set to `completed`
4. To add or drop work, resend the list with tasks added or omitted
5. When the request is complete, leave the completed tasks in place so the session retains its execution record. Clear them only when the user explicitly asks.

Tasks persist with the current session outside the working repository. Resuming that session restores them; `/clear` starts a new session without deleting the old task record.
